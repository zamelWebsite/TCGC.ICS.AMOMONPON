                <h4><p class="Z-name">Zamel U. Amomonpon</p>
                    An 18-year-old college freshman pursui ng a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.<br>
                    Ready to code, innovate, and explore the limitless world of tech!
                </h4></img>

                <h3 class="H-feature">
                    Growing up, I was always curious about how things worked, especially anything tech-related.
                    Whether it was tinkering with gadgets or marveling at how software powers so much of our daily lives,
                    I was hooked. That curiosity is what led me to choose Computer Science—a field that constantly challenges
                    me to think critically, solve problems, and learn new things every day.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But life isn't just about academics. I believe in balance. Outside of school, I spend time exploring creative ideas,
                    connecting with friends, and grabbing any opportunity to grow as a person. I love trying out new projects,
                    brainstorming innovative concepts, and challenging myself in ways that help me become better both personally and professionally.
                    What drives me most is my goal to use what I learn to make a real impact. I dream of building software that makes life better for people,
                    strengthens connections, and tackles real-world problems. I believe that even the smallest innovations can create ripples of change when
                    paired with hard work and determination.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is just the beginning of my journey, and I'm excited about what lies ahead. Each project I take on and every new skill I learn brings me 
                    closer to shaping the future I've envisioned. For me, coding isn't just about technology—it's about creating something meaningful and inspiring 
                    others to believe in their dreams, just like I do with mine.
